The platform serves endless purposes such as; entertainment, marketing, video storage, news, and education. With a platform used by billions of people around the globe there are many videos shared every second and it is up to Machine Learning algorithms to regulate that content. Constantly researching how well these algorithms are at analyzing and predicting content is essential for YouTube to improve their models and for users to improve their content. New findings will help keep YouTube a successful platform to keep them in business.\\n\",\n",

    "    \"Prior research has analyzed which Machine Learning prediction models are best at predicting how long it would take a video to trend and also how long that video will last on the trending list. A specific study analyzed how YouTube’s interactive features play a role in helping a video trend. The features include comments, views, likes, suggested videos linked, date uploaded, and disabled features. The results from this study shows that the models that are best at predicting a video’s trending aspects are Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine classifiers. In addition, logarithmic miner regression is also a good model to use for supervised datasets. Some limitations to consider from this study for future research is that deep learning could not be implemented and they also kept in mind that the initial data set used is limited because it may not be generalizable to all content.<a name=\\\"lorenz\\\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lorenznote).\\n\",\n",

    "    \"Another data science study observed characteristics of trending videos in 2019, knowing these characteristics can be useful for YouTubers to keep in mind when uploading content and will help strengthen prediction models. On average videos that trended were more likely to be uploaded on a Tuesday vs a Saturday and to be uploaded around noon vs the morning in eastern time. An interesting observation is that videos trend on average 5.6 days after uploading but usually no longer than 13 days after they’re uploaded. Aside from time, titles of trending videos were also taken into consideration, the characterizations found were that the average length was 36-64 characters with half of the titles being in all caps and “official” was the most common word found in them. The last characteristic to note is that tags showed a positive correlation with a video trending, on average 21 tags were used per trending video. This data is limited to 2019 and future studies can observe how these characterizations change over the years. <a name=\\\"admonish\\\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#admonishnote).\"\n",

Some variables that would be relevant to identifying these patterns are the category the video is under, any tags it has, time and location of posting, the channel it is posted under, and the title of the video. These factors could easily determine how much exposure the video gets, and how interesting the video appears to people, initiating engagement. We could also compare the views and likes to get an idea of the numerical value that trending videos hold. Sentiment analysis would help us study the affective states of our information, particularly useful in looking for patterns within the text of the video, where the data is more subjective/emotional.\\n\",\n",
