    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",

    "  Youtube’s algorithm has constantly been scrutinized. Many creators and viewers complain that the algorithm set in place has biases and doesn’t truly reflect the content that is “trending”. Which is why we want to dive into Youtube trending data. \n",
    "    \n",
    "  We are trying to observe any pattern in the Youtube trending algorithm. Our main goal is to predict how likely a video is to get onto the trend page. We intend on observing past patterns and using those patterns to predict how likely it is for it to trend in different nations. We want to take into account the region, the text associated with the video, and potentially see if there are patterns based on the creator that pushes “trending” content out."

    "- The observations consist of information relating to the time of the trending video, the video title, its description, and general numerical performances of said video.\n",
    "- Some critical variables relate to the time and date of the trending video. For a text analysis, the critical videos would be the title and description of each video. For the representation of each of these variables it is dependent on how they were inputed. Meaning the text portions are represented in text format while the numerical data is stored as numerical quantities. \n",
